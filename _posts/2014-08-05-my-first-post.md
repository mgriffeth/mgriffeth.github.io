And so it begins...
=================

  I have it on [good athority](johnsaddington.com) that blogging, in short, is a good thing that should be done frequently and consistently.
I've never been what I would consider the "blogging type", which is not to say that I have any real idea of what that
would even mean, just that i didn't want to participate. There was never really anything I wanted to share with the
world. That's what you do when you put your thoughts and ideas out the on the big scary interwebs.
Your ideas are there for anyone to see. You open yourself up to the scrutiny of the world. Granted most of the world is probably
unaware that you even exist or cares for that matter, but to open yourself up, make yourself vulnerable is kinda scary.
